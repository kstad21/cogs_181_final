### This Repo contains the code I used to train a charr-rnn model on many different texts, then generate output by using one of those texts as input for a trained model. `vis.ipynb` contains a visualization of my results. Check out the `results` folder if you're curious about what is generated by a model trained on Shakespeare when it is fed text from the Iliad. There are 450 different generations in that folder! 

This is the repository for the charr-rnn: [*this repository*](https://github.com/spro/char-rnn.pytorch)
