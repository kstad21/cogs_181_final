### This Repo contains the code I used to train a charr-rnn model on many different texts, then generate output by using one of those texts as input for a trained model. `vis.ipynb` contains a visualization of my results. 

This is the repository for the charr-rnn: [*this repository*](https://github.com/spro/char-rnn.pytorch)
